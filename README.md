## Next.js TypeScript Tailwind Starter

This is a Next.js project template that provides a streamlined starting point for web development with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It includes pre-configured tools like ESLint and Prettier, and features like absolute imports for a smoother development experience.


## Key Features

- Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation
- TypeScript for type safety and improved code maintainability
- ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting
- Absolute imports for simplified module resolution

## Get Started

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
